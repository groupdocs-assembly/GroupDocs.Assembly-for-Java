## Generating Report in Microsoft Word Document

### Creating a Template

1.  Add a bullet list at the place where you want it to display clients' names.
2.  Insert a table with two columns, that will show managers' and their contact prices.
3.  Save your Document

### Reporting Requirement

As a report developer, you are required to generate a report that fetches data from two different data sources (e:g custom object, excel data table). Report must show following information:

*   Bulleted list of clients
*   A table showing managers' along with their contract prices and sum of contract prices

### Adding Syntax to be evaluated by GroupDocs.Assembly Engine

We provide support for the following clients:
```
- <<foreach [in getClients()]>><<[getName()]>>
<</foreach>>
```

**Total Contract Prices by Managers**

| **Manager**                                                  | **Total Contract Price**                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **<<foreach [group in contracts**<br />    **.groupBy(c => c.Manager)**<br />    **.orderBy(g => g.key)]>><br /><<[group.key]>>** | <<[group.sum(<br />    c => c.Contract_Price)]>><br /><</foreach>> |
