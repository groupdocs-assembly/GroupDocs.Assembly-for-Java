## Numbered List in Microsoft Excel Document

### Creating a Numbered List

Practising the following steps you can create Numbered List Template in MS Excel 2013.  
You can create two kinds of Numbered List in Microsoft Excel.

*   In-cell List
*   Multiple-cell List

Apply the following steps to build the In-Cell template

1.  Add a new Workbook.
2.  Write a sentence, for example "We provide support for the following clients:" in a single cell and add syntax there.
3.  Save the template.

### Reporting Requirement

As a report developer, you are required to represent the following key requirements:

*   Report must show the client names in numbered list.
*   Report must be generated in the Spreadsheet Document.

### Adding Syntax to be evaluated by GroupDocs.Assembly Engine

**In-cell List**

```java
"We provide support for the following clients:<<foreach [in getClients()]>>
<<[numberOf()]>>.         <<[getName()]>><</foreach>>"

```

**Multiple-cell List**

```java
<<foreach [in getClients()]>><<[numberOf()]>>.         <<[getName()]>>

```

<</foreach>>

### ODS Template and Report in Apache OpenOffice

In order to check compatibility of ODS between Microsoft Office 2010 and Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2, we performed below tests:

*   We opened the ODS template created through Microsoft Office 2010 in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2. The template opened successfully in Apache OpenOffice without any issues or formatting losses.
*   We opened the ODS report generated through GroupDocs.Assembly in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2. The report opened successfully in Apache OpenOffice without any issues or formatting losses.
