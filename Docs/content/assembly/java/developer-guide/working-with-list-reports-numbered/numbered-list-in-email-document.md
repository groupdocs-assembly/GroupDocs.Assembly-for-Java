## Numbered List in Email Document

### Creating a Numbered List

Practicing the following steps you can create Numbered List Template in MS Outlook 2013.

1.  Create a new Email.
2.  Write a sentence like "We provide support for the following clients:".
3.  Start numbered list.
4.  Save the template.

### Reporting Requirement

As a report developer, you are required to represent the following key requirements:

*   Report must be in .eml or .msg format.
*   It must add email recipient, css and subject of the email.
*   Report must show the client names in a numbered list.

### Adding Syntax to be evaluated by GroupDocs.Assembly Engine

```java
We provide support for the following clients:
1<<foreach [in getClients()]>><<[numberOf()]>>. <<[getName()]>>
<</foreach>>
```

## Restart Numbering in Nested Numbered List 

{{< alert style="info" >}}This feature is supported by version 19.7 or greater.{{< /alert >}}


The GroupDocs.Assembly engine allows restart list numbering within your documents dynamically using *<<restartNum>>* tags. In particular, this feature is useful when working with a nested numbered list within a data band.

Assume that we are picking *Order* and *Service* classes as defined in the following *Custom Objects* of our business use case.

{{< gist GroupDocsGists ffcdf1d202f0e706b98796c722e438e3 >}}

Given that orders is an enumeration of Order instances, you could try to use the following template to output information on several orders in one document.

```java
<<foreach [in getContracts()]>><<[getClient().getName()]>> (Manager: <<[getManager().getName()]>>)
1.  <<foreach [service in getServices()]>><<[service.getName()]>>
<</foreach>><</foreach>>
```

The generated report will look as follows:
```
A Company (Manager: John Smith)
	1.	Regular Cleaning
	2.	Oven Cleaning
B Ltd. (Manager: John Smith)
	3.	Regular Cleaning
	4.	Oven Cleaning
C & D (Manager: John Smith)
	5.	Regular Cleaning
	6.	Oven Cleaning
E Corp. (Manager: Tony Anderson)
	7.	Regular Cleaning
	8.	Oven Cleaning
	9.	Carpet Cleaning
F & Partners (Manager: Tony Anderson)
	10.	Regular Cleaning
	11.	Oven Cleaning
	12.	Carpet Cleaning
```

However, there would be a single numbered list across all orders, which is not applicable for this scenario. Hence, you can make the list numbering to restart for every order by putting a *<<restartNum>>* tag into your template before a corresponding *<<foreach>>* tag as follows:

```java
<<foreach [in getContracts()]>><<[getClient().getName()]>> (Manager:<<[getManager().getName()]>>)
1.  <<restartNum>><<foreach [service in getServices()]>><<[service.getName()]>>
<</foreach>><</foreach>>
```

 Then, the generated report will look as follows:
```
A Company (Manager: John Smith)
	1.	Regular Cleaning
	2.	Oven Cleaning
B Ltd. (Manager: John Smith)
	1.	Regular Cleaning
	2.	Oven Cleaning
C & D (Manager: John Smith)
	1.	Regular Cleaning
	2.	Oven Cleaning
E Corp. (Manager: Tony Anderson)
	1.	Regular Cleaning
	2.	Oven Cleaning
	3.	Carpet Cleaning
F & Partners (Manager: Tony Anderson)
	1.	Regular Cleaning
	2.	Oven Cleaning
	3.	Carpet Cleaning
```
