### Creating a Pie Chart

Please follow below steps to create Pie Chart in MS Excel 2013.

1.  Add a new Workbook.
2.  Click in the workbook where you want to insert the chart, click the "Insert" tab, and then click "Pie Chart Icon" in the charts group.
3.  A drop-down with charts will appear, select the "Pie" and press "OK" to insert the chart.
4.  Click on the chart you just inserted, then click the "Change Data" icon in Data group.
5.  Now add legend entries. See [Chart Data]({{< ref "assembly/java/developer-guide/working-with-chart-reports-pie/pie-chart-in-spreadsheet-document.md" >}})
6.  Save your Document.

### Reporting Requirement

As a report developer, you are required to share managers' contract prices dynamically with the following key requirements:

*   Report must show information on a Pie Chart.
*   It must indicate manager name with value (price of the contract).
*   Report must be generated in the Spreadsheet Document.

### Adding Syntax to be evaluated by GroupDocs.Assembly Engine

#### Chart Title

```java
Total Contract Price<<foreach [in getManagers()]>><<x [getName()]>>

```

#### Chart Data

**Legend Entries**

```java
="Total Contract Price<<y [getContracts().sum(c => c.getPrice())]>>"

```
