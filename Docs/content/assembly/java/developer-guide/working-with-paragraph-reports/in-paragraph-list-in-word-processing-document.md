## In-Paragraph List in Microsoft Word Document

### Creating a In-Paragraph List

Practising the following steps you can create In-Paragraph List Template in MS Word 2013.

1.  Write a sentence, for example, "We provide support for the following clients:".
2.  Save the template.

### Reporting Requirement

As a report developer, you are required to describe about the clients with the following key requirements:

*   A descriptive or informative line like "We provide support for the following clients:".
*   Show all the clients along with the above sentence.
*   Report must be generated in the Word Processing Document.

### Adding Syntax to be evaluated by GroupDocs.Assembly Engine

```java
We provide support for the following clients: <<foreach [in getClients()]>>
<<[indexOf() != 0 ? ", " : ""]>><<[getName()]>><</foreach>>

```

### ODT Template and Report in Apache OpenOffice

In order to check compatibility of ODT between Microsoft Office 2010 and Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2, we performed below tests:

*   We opened the ODT template created through Microsoft Office 2010 in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2. The template opened successfully in Apache OpenOffice without any issues or formatting losses.
*   We opened the ODT report generated through GroupDocs.Assembly in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2. The report opened successfully in Apache OpenOffice without any issues or formatting losses.
