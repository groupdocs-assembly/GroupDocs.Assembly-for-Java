## In-Paragraph List in Microsoft PowerPoint Document

### Creating a In-Paragraph List

Practising the following steps you can create In-Paragraph List Template in MS PowerPoint 2013.

1.  Add a new presentation slide.
2.  Write a sentence, for example "We provide support for the following clients:".
3.  Save the template.

*   A descriptive or informative line like "We provide support for the following clients:".
*   Show all the clients along with the above sentence.
*   Report must be generated in the Presentation Document.

<<[indexOf() != 0 ? ", " : ""]>><<[getName()]>><</foreach>>

```

### ODP Template and Report in Apache OpenOffice

In order to check compatibility of ODP between Microsoft Office 2010 and Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2, we performed below tests:

*   We opened the ODP template created through Microsoft Office 2010 in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2. The template opened successfully in Apache OpenOffice without any issues or formatting losses.
*   We opened the ODP report generated through GroupDocs.Assembly in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2. The report opened successfully in Apache OpenOffice without any issues or formatting losses.
