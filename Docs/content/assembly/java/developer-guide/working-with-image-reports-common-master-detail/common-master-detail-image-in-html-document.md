## Common Master-Detail Image in HTML Document

### Reporting Requirement

As a report developer, you are required to represent the information of the managers and clients with the following key requirements:

*   Report must show managers' picture and name.
*   It must associate the managers with their clients.
*   Report must be generated in the HTML Document.

### Adding Syntax to be evaluated by GroupDocs.Assembly Engine

```java
<<foreach [in getManagers()]
>> 
<<[getName()]>>
Clients: <<foreach [in getContracts()]>><<[indexOf() != 0 ? ", " : ""]>><<[getClient().getName()]>><</foreach>>
<</foreach>>

```
