# Saving to HTML with External Resource Files

Since version 19.5, The [GroupDocs.Assembly](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/java/assembly/com.groupdocs.assembly/package-summary) provides a great feature which is saving of external resource files while an assembled document loaded from a non-HTML format is being saved to HTML.

From now on, when saving an assembled document to an HTML file, by default, external resource files are stored to a folder having the same name as the HTML file without extension plus the "\_files" suffix. This folder is located in the same folder as the HTML file. The following example illustrates the scenario. The following code snippet shows the way of API usage:

In the following example, the default folder used to store HTML resource files is overridden by an explicitly specified folder.
