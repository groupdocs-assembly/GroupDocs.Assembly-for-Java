## Bulleted List in Microsoft Excel Document

### Creating a Bulleted List

Practising the following steps you can insert Bulleted List in MS Excel 2013.  
Adding a bulleted list in Microsoft Excel is different than Microsoft Word. Moreover, there are two ways to apply bulleted list in Microsoft Excel:

*   In-Cell List
*   Multiple-Cell List

Apply the following steps to build the In-Cell template

1.  Add a new Workbook.
2.  Press Insert Tab (at the top-bar).
3.  Add bullet symbol by clicking on Symbol icon.
4.  Save the Document.

### Reporting Requirement

*   Report must show all the clients in a bulleted list format.
*   Report must be generated in the Spreadsheet Document.

### ODS Template and Report in Apache OpenOffice

In order to check compatibility of ODS between Microsoft Office 2010 and Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2, we performed below tests:

*   We opened the ODS template created through Microsoft Office 2010 in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2. The template opened successfully in Apache OpenOffice without any issues or formatting losses.
*   We opened the ODS report generated through GroupDocs.Assembly in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.2. The report opened successfully in Apache OpenOffice without any issues or formatting losses.
